# chooser

The Creative Commons License Chooser is meant to help people learn about CC licenses, and select the license that best fits their needs. The new version in this repo places greater importance on usability, and an educational experience of the six CC licenses.

## About

Repository containing the source code for the new Creative Commons License Chooser. The new chooser is still in beta, and a beta deployment can be found [here](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/).

This site is built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (and vue-cli).

### Roadmap

Tasks, issues, and discussion related to the release of the new chooser are tracked with the [`Launch Milestone`](https://github.com/creativecommons/chooser/milestone/1).

## Getting Started

Run the following commands in order to have the code up and running on your machine:

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```

```bash
# Build and serve assets with hot-reload
npm run serve
```

You should now have the application running and accessible at <http://localhost:8080> (note: will run on a different port if 8080 is occupied, most common alternative port is 8081).

## Building as web component
To build the project as a web component, run the command `npm run build-component`. This will create a file in the `dist` folder named `license-chooser.min.js`. It can be used to load the web-component in any JS project. There is also a sample `demo.html` created.
To be able to use the file it should either be rendered statically from the integrater's web-app or be published on a CDN. Following code can be used to integrate this in other apps:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@creativecommons/chooser/dist/license-chooser.js"></script>

<license-chooser></license-chooser>
```

If the web component is intended to be built without header and footer, run `VUE_APP_CC_OUTPUT=embedded npm run build-component`

## Running Tests

You can run tests by executing:

```bash
npm run test
```
For running tests on a web-component build, run `npm run test-component`. It starts a server with the  `dist/demo.html` on which tests can be run.


## CSS Build

The Chooser uses PostCSS plugin for PurgeCSS to make CSS bundle size smaller. It automatically removes unused CSS based on the classes found in the final built bundle. Some styles for dynamic components or dynamically-imported files can also be removed. If you find that the built site misses some styles, you can manually add the necessary classes or Regex expressions to the `safelist` array in the `postcss.config.js` file.

## Deployment

The chooser is deployed to GitHub Pages. The source files for the beta deployment are contained in the `./docs/` dir, and are live. Any changes to this directory's contents will be automatically deployed, so please take care when making modifications to this location.

To update the dist bundle, run ```$ npm run build```. This will also automatically copy the generated files from `./dist/` to `./docs/`.

## Output Modes

The site can be built in two different modes: `embedded` and `standalone`. `Embedded` mode removes the header and footer from the application, resulting in the following appearance:

<img src="static/embedded-screenshot.png" alt="Application built in embedded mode">

To build into embedded mode, set the environment variable `VUE_APP_CC_OUTPUT=embedded` on your server before building. If `VUE_APP_CC_OUTPUT` is unset or set to a different value, the app will build in the default `standalone` mode, with its own header and footer.
